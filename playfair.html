<title>Playfair Cipher</title>
<h1>Playfair Cipher</h1>
<h2>How to Solve</h2>
<p>The Playfair cipher uses a 5 by 5 table containing a key word or phrase. 
To generate the table, <br>one would first fill in the spaces of the table with the
 letters of the keyword (dropping any duplicate letters),<br> then fill the remaining 
spaces with the rest of the letters of the alphabet in order <br>(to reduce the alphabet to
fit you can either omit "Q" or replace "J" with "I"). In the example to the right, the keyword is "keyword".</p><br> 
<div>
<p>To encrypt a message, one would break the message into groups of 2 letters. 
If there is a dangling letter at the end,<br> we add an X.For example. 
"Secret Message" becomes "SE CR ET ME SS AG EX". We now take <br>each group and find them out on the table.
 Noticing the location of the two letters in the table,<br> we apply the following rules, in order.

<div>
<p class="ins">1.If both letters are the same, add an X between them. Encrypt the new pair, re-pair the remining letters and continue.<br> <br>

2.If the letters appear on the same row of your table, replace them with the letters to their immediate right respectively, <br>
wrapping around to the left side of the row if necessary. For example, using the table above, <br>the letter pair GJ would be encoded as HF. <br> <br>

3.If the letters appear on the same column of your table, replace them with the letters immediately below,<br>
 wrapping around to the top if necessary. For example, using the table above,the letter pair<br> MD would be encoded as UG.<br> <br>

4.If the letters are on different rows and columns, replace them with the letters on the same row respectively <br>
 but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair.
The order<br> is important - the first letter of the pair should be replaced first. <br>
For example, using the table above, the letter pair EB would be encoded as WD.</p> <br>
</div>
<div>
<p>To decipher, ignore rule 1. In rules 2 and 3 shift up and left instead of down and right.<br>
 Rule 4 remains the same. Once you are done, drop any extra Xs that don't make sense <br>
 in the final message and locate any missing Qs or any Is that should be Js. <br></p>
